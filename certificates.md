* Create and work on relational databases with multiple tables
* Intermediate to advanced SQL techniques incuding views, transactions, stored procedures and joins 

## Neural Networks


These courses where the 'homework' part of two modules I attended in University: 

### Neural Networks from scratch
Part of [Deep Learning Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/deep-learnin)

What I learned:
- How to build a neural network from scratch without tensorflow
- Mathematical background of neural networks
- Hyperparameter tuning, regularization and optimization

### Deep Learning with Tensorflow
Part of [DeepLearning.AI TensorFlow Developer Professional Certificate](https://www.coursera.org/professional-certificates/tensorflow-in-practice)

What I learned:
- Implementation of Neural Networks into tensorflow
- Hyperparameter search and optimization with tensorflow

In my transcript of records they are listed as OpenCampus Praxisprojekt and OpenCampus Digitale Praxis
