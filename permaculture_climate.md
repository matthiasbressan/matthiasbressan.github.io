In this project we want to aid people who have a garden or want to create one, by providing weather data and weather projections specifically for their location.

Beeing both a gardener and a biologist, I know first hand how important the weather can be for a garden and the organisms living in it. Here we want to provide people who might already have a garden or plan to start a new one with useful weather data. 
As a garden can be a longtime commitment, we also provide data for how the weather is supposed to evolve


## Past dataset

The dataset used for the past weather data is the [ERA5 monthly averaged data on single levels from 1940 to present](https://cds.climate.copernicus.eu/cdsapp#!/dataset/reanalysis-era5-single-levels-monthly-means?tab=overview).

## Projection dataset

For the projecton data we opted for the [CMIP6 climate projections](https://cds.climate.copernicus.eu/cdsapp#!/dataset/projections-cmip6?tab=form) dataset coming from CDS. This dataset assumes a rise in temperature of 4.5 Â°C, as well as a shared socioeconomic pathway index of 2. We opted for those two options as they offer a scenario with intermediate challenges and are the middle pathway of all available scenarios. 

For more information we recommend the paper: [The Scenario Model Intercomparison Project (ScenarioMIP)
for CMIP6](https://gmd.copernicus.org/articles/9/3461/2016/gmd-9-3461-2016.pdf).
